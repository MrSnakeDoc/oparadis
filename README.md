## Why did we develop this API ?

This API was the pinacle of our bootcamp. We were asked to develop a full app with frontend and backend as a end of study project. The frontend was developed separately from the backend.
The goal of this project was to provide a way for people to experience the home-sitting.
As a matter of fact, all similar websites are only oriented to retired people. We wanted to open this type of experience to a larger group and let responsible young people to be able to enjoy this type of holidays.

### What services are we proposing

**Main features**

- **Profile Creation and edit** : Create your profile and edit it as you want.
- **Add a house profile with photos**: Create your house profile, and find a home-sitter to keep your house.
- **Add animals and plants** : Create a profile to your animals or plants that you want home-sitter to take care of.
- **Add your absences** : Add your absences to let home-sitter know when they can apply to come to your house.

## Setup

Clone `dev` branch into your personal repository. Clone it to local computer. Install node modules. Before starting development, you should check if there are any errors.

With https:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/MrSnakeDoc/oparadis.git
$ npm install
$ npm run dev
```

With ssh:

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:MrSnakeDoc/oparadis.git
$ npm install
$ npm run dev
```

First you need to have two database local or remote.

For local with docker:

```bash
$ sudo docker run -d --name Postgres -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=root -e POSTGRES_USER=root -p 55432:5432 --restart unless-stopped postgres
$ sudo docker run --name redisdocker -d redis -p 6379:6379 --restart unless-stopped redis
```

You'll need to create a database inside your Postgres container

```bash
$ sudo docker exec -it Postgres bash
$ psql
$ CREATE DATABASE oparadis
```

Then you need to fill your .env file with environment variables.

```bash
$ cp .env.example .env
```

You will need to create an account on [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/) and take the cloud_name, api_key, and api_secret and add it to the .env file.

Open your .env file and add these lines to your .env file:

```.env
DATABASE_URL = postgresql://root:root@localhost:55432/oparadis
REDIS_URL = redis://default:root@localhost:6379
JWT_SECRET = addyourlongsecretstring
REFRESH_JWT_SECRET = addyourlongsecretstring
CLOUD_NAME = yourcloud_name
API_KEY = yourapikey
API_SECRET = yourapisecret
```
